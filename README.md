# Spec Overflow - Sample application for the SpecFlow Masterclass

A simple Q&A site where people can ask questions and post answers. 

**Features:**

* User management & Home page
* Questions
* List & Details
* Ask & Answer
* Vote questions & answers

**Technology:**

* ASP.NET MVC
* Backend with REST API
* Simple web frontend accessing the backend using basic jQuery

**Open-source:** Explore, fork, play, contribute!

_Note:_ The sample application uses the concept of Rules, but these are represented as comments in the 
feature files, because the "SpecFlow for Visual Studio 2019" extension does not yet support the `Rule` 
keyword. If you use the [Deveroom for SpecFlow](https://github.com/specsolutions/deveroom-visualstudio) extension for Visual Studio or Rider, you can check 
the branch [`rules-and-cucumber-expressions`](https://github.com/gasparnagy/SpecFlowMasterClass.SpecOverflow/tree/rules-and-cucumber-expressions).
